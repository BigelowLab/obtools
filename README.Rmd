Extra R-language tools to supplement [obpg R package](https://github.com/BigelowLab/obpg). This package serves up R scripts to create a local data repository, or to update a local data repository on a regular basis.  

# Requirements for package
  + [R v4.1+](https://www.r-project.org/)
  + [yaml](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=yaml)
  
# Requirements for scripts
The scripts can be pretty much anything that suits your needs.  The default scripts that come with this package do require some packages which are listed here.

  + [obpg](https://github.com/BigelowLab/obpg)
  + [argparser](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=argparser)
  + [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
  + [stars](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stars)
  + [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf)
  
# Scripts

 + [update_obpg.R](inst/scripts/obpg_update.R) is used to update a particular data set by examining the existising database.  It then attempts to fetch files on the server server that are newer than the most recent database record.  It works for multiple parameters, but one resolution/region/instrument at a time. It draws upon a configuration [such as this one](inst/config/nwa_AQUA_4km_day.yaml).
